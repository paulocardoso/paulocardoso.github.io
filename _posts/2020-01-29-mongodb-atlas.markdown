 Recently i had a change of trying MongoDB Atlas, it's the new fully-managed cloud database solution. Mongodb is already a very known noSql document based database in the Market, now Mongo provides a new completely solution based on public clouds such as AWS and Azure.
  

Getting Started
---------------

After you create your account, which takes a couple of seconds, it offeers three models.

After select your plan, without any coding, you can easily select which Cloud Provider, Region, Cluster Tier, that better fits with your requirements.

 Once you define your choices, your cluster after some minutes will be ready to start.

<p>
within the Atlas console you have a integrate interface that allows you to setup network security, access management and Monitoring and you are ready to start creating your collections and documents.

But what are the advantages?
---------------

Beside of the fact of how fast and easily you can you can have a new cluster. Mantain an database cluster on Cloud, it's something that requires not only a cloud provider but a good DevOps and IT team to mantain, all the common challenges, that we normally have: Monitoring, Backups, High Aliability Achiving and so on.

Atlas Provides all the features that a normal Mongo DB licence, without all the cost of maintain a infrastructe, even in your private or hibrid cloud, and you don't lose the control of your data.



Considerations
---------------

If you already uses MongoDB as your database, and have plans to move to cloud or already mantains a instance, give a try yourself on Atlas.
